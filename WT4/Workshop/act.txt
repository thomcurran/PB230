# Activity

Okay, lets do some diagnosis on some ANOVA data to give you a chance to practice.

The data are taken from last years secondary data assignment. If you remember, I gave you some data from an online retailer interested in improving their workers' productivity at work with music. To test whether music had an impact on productivity, a researcher recruited a sample of 150 and randomly split them into three groups:

1. a "control group" that did not listen to music (no_music)

2.  a "treatment group" who listened to music, but had no choice of what they listened to (music_no_choice)

3. a second treatment group who listened to music and had a choice of what they listened to (music_choice)

After a month of intervention, productivity was measured.

The research question was:

RQ: Is there a statistically significant difference in productivity between the three conditions?

You task is to diagnose this data for normality of residuals and equality of variance.

First lets load in the data:

```{r}
music_data <- read_csv("C:/Users/CURRANT/Dropbox/Work/LSE/PB230/LT1/Workshop/music_data.csv")
head(perfectionism)
```


## Task 1: Setting up the Model

In the chunk below, write the code to create the build the ANOVA model using aov. Save the model as "music.model"

```{r}
music.model <- aov(productivity ~ condition, data = music_data)
```

## Task 2: Plot the normality of residuals

Use the below chunk to write the code to plot a histogram and QQ-plot for the residuals.

```{r}
# histogram
hist(music.model$residuals)

# QQ-plot
qqPlot(music.model$residuals) 
```

What can we say about the normality of the residuals from a visual inspection?

## Task 3: Test the normality of residuals

Use the below chunk to write the code for the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality

```{r}
shapiro.test(music.model$residuals)
```

What can we say about the normality of the residuals from this analysis?

## Task 4: Plot the equaltiy of variance

In the chunk below write the code to plot the distributions of the conditions in this experiment using box-plots.

```{r}
boxplot(productivity ~ condition, data = music_data)
```

What can we say about the equality of variances from a visual inspection?

## Task 5: Test the homogenity of variances

Use the below chunk to write the code for the Levene's test of equality of variances.

```{r}
leveneTest(productivity ~ condition, data = music_data)
```

What can we say about the equality of variances from this analysis?
